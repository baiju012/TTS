1. Project Overview
This project benchmarks two popular text-to-speech (TTS) models, Tacotron2 and FastSpeech2, for inference time and model size. The task involves synthesizing speech from a given text input using pre-trained models from the ESPnet model zoo.

2. Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Google Colab or a similar environment
Install required packages using the following commands:

pip install transformers espnet_model_zoo torch

3. Model Descriptions
Tacotron2: A sequence-to-sequence model for TTS that generates mel spectrograms from text.
FastSpeech2: A non-autoregressive TTS model known for faster inference while maintaining high-quality output.

5. Steps to Run the Benchmark
Clone/download this repository to your local system.
Install necessary libraries using the given command.
Load pre-trained models using the ESPnet model zoo.
Run the provided Python script to benchmark Tacotron2 and FastSpeech2.

7. Input Text
A simple English sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
The script tokenizes this input text for use with both models.

9. Benchmarking Metrics
Inference Time: Measures the time taken by each model to generate output from the input text.
Model Size: Calculates the size of each model in MB (megabytes).

11. Expected Output
Inference time (seconds) for both models.
The size of each model in MB.

13. Dependencies
Transformers: For loading the tokenizer and managing text inputs.
ESPnet Model Zoo: For downloading and using pre-trained TTS models.
Torch: For running inference on the models.
